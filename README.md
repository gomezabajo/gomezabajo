From 2008 to 2015 Pablo Gómez-Abajo was working as an IT Manager at Ingeniería y Prevención de Riesgos, S.L. During this time, he acquired high-level skills in developing solutions for professionals from other technological areas, such as civil engineers, mechanical engineers, and so on. This provides him with a great ability to understand what their needs are and build the easiest solution for them.

To keep improving his skills as an ICT professional, in 2015 he joined the Modelling and Software Engineering research group led by Juan de Lara and Esther Guerra within the Computer Science Department of the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. His research works consist mainly in the design and development of domain-specific languages and generic tools for domain experts. In 2016 he defended his final master's thesis "A framework for the automated generation of exercises via model mutation", directed by Esther Guerra and Juan de Lara, with a special mention as its final mark. In 2020 he defended his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering with the title "A domain-specific language for model mutation", directed by Esther Guerra and Mercedes García Merayo, with the highest possible mark. He has been the author of 4 journal publications, 1 book chapter, and has published in 8 international conferences.

Since 2019 he holds a position as an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department of the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. During this period, he has been teaching courses on "Compilers" (120h.) and "Automata Theory" (30h.) of the degree in Computer Science. He has directed two final projects of the degree in Computer Science, both with a "Notable" as the final mark.
